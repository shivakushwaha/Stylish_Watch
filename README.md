# stylish_watch

A stylish watch Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Before cloning repository make sure your flutter set up is ready.

I face some difficulty to build the actual logic of the timer.
I used NumberPicker library to pick a number for timer.

Stapwatch provides a specific library therefor it is not too difficult to implement.

Following are some picture of this app.
